# Student Residence
C# arrays project

The owner of a residence has ten rooms to rent to students, with the rooms identified by numbers 0 to 9.
When a student wishes to rent a room, the name and email of the student must be recorded.
Create a program that starts with all ten rooms empty, and then reads a quantity N representing the number of students who will rent rooms (N can be from 1 to 10). Then, register the rental of the N students. For each rental record, inform the name and email of the student, as well as which room they chose (from 0 to 9). Assume that an empty room is chosen. Finally, the program should print a report of all the residence's occupancies, in room order, as an example.
